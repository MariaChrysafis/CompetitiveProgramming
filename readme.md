## About Me
Hello, I am Maria Chrysafis. In my spare time, I like doing competitive programming and math (although I prefer the former to the latter). 

In particular, I enjoy doing Codeforces, USACO, and LeetCode contests.

My Codeforces profile is here: https://codeforces.com/profile/olympia. As of now, I am in the specialist rank.
My LeetCode profile is here: https://leetcode.com/passionFruitFlower/. I haven't used the platform much.
As for USACO, I am in the USACO Silver division with aspirations to get to the Gold division.
