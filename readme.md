## About Me
Hello, I am Maria Chrysafis. In my spare time, I like doing competitive programming and math (although I prefer the former to the latter). 

In particular, I enjoy doing Codeforces, USACO, and LeetCode contests.

- [My Codeforces profile is here](https://codeforces.com/profile/olympia). As of now, I am in the specialist rank.
- [My LeetCode profile is here](https://leetcode.com/passionFruitFlower/). I haven't used the platform much.
- As for USACO, I am in the USACO Silver division with aspirations to get to the Gold division.

I use vim, and I also like toying around with Linux on a Virtual Machine. I'm a proponent of open source because I value transparency.
